## What is Assembly language 
In this section we talked about what is assembly language and what is it used for and what types of architecture do we have.


## Data Types in Assembly language
We talked about data types such as WORD, DWORD, BYTE,etc. and this section is one of the most important aspects of assembly language 

## Registers
Register are small (really small!) storage places in the CPU that holds data or memory addresses, and in this section we discussed registers and why they are useful for us and what types of registers we have, and their job
